# Overview
We often talk about teams in terms of their characteristics and styles, by where they funnel resources, where they dig up early advantages, and how certain laners stand out in their leagues. But beyond the astute observers and analysts that identify these patterns, what can the data tell us about each team's unique playstyles and which aspects can be considered strengths versus weaknesses? This project aims to utilize data and machine learning to systematically identify these underlying patterns and styles. We analyze over 10k games and over 1k features per game for predictive modeling and interpretation of key strategies that pave the path to victory.
